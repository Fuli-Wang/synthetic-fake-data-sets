# synthetic(fake)-data-sets


We create some synthetic data to train the [Pix2Pix](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix)/[Pix2PixHD](https://github.com/NVIDIA/pix2pixHD) model for object detection.

There is a [demo](https://youtu.be/fYPpXOAjzsM) of the generation process of the synthetic data set.

Besides, some datasets (like sandwiches) can be used to label for other deep learning models.  

A strawberry model is provided in Models

To run the model to test the offline image:

    python3 gan_offline.py
